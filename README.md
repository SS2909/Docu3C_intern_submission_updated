# Problem Statement # 1 : Developing a Strategic Legal Preparation Tool (AI & Machine Learning)

In the fast-paced world of legal proceedings, thorough preparation is the cornerstone of success. As a technology expert collaborating with a seasoned attorney, you are tasked with developing an innovative application to aid in the meticulous preparation for an upcoming court case. The attorney, renowned for her comprehensive approach, requires a tool that will distill the essence of the document titled "Amicus Brief on behalf of Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas."

The challenge lies in creating an application that can efficiently sift through the complexities of the document to identify the top 10 key items that are pivotal to the case. These items must encompass both the arguments for and against, providing a balanced perspective that is crucial for strategic planning. Furthermore, the application must offer precise references as attributions, including page numbers and line numbers, to ensure that the attorney can swiftly access the relevant sections of the document to dive deeper.

This tool is not merely a convenience; it is an essential component of the attorney's preparation arsenal. By delivering a detailed breakdown of the most significant elements, the application will empower the attorney to navigate the intricacies of the case with confidence and precision. The ultimate goal is to enhance the attorney's ability to focus on the critical aspects of the trial, ensuring a well-informed and effective representation in court.
